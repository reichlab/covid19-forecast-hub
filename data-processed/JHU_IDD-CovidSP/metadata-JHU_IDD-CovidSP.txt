methods_long: "This is a county-level metapopulation model with stochastic SEIR disease\
  \  dynamics. This model incorporates uncertainty in epidemiological parameters \
  \ and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies on social  distancing\
  \ and stay-at-home orders. Infections are seeded stochastically  with roughly 10\
  \ times the number of confirmed cases in the first five days  of a county epidemic\
  \ and R0 and the duration of the infectious period were  drawn stochastically for\
  \ each county and simulation. Disease follows SEIR  dynamics and county commuting\
  \ data modulates the spread of disease within  counties. \nStay-at-home orders were\
  \ applied and lifted at the state level according to  recent policy documents. After\
  \ stay-at-home orders end, social distancing  remains in effect through the end\
  \ of the simulation with a roughly 25%  reduction in effectiveness relative to that\
  \ from stay-at-home orders. States  that did not implement stay-at-home orders had\
  \ a single social distancing  intervention that began on the day of the first reported\
  \ order and endured  for the whole simulation period. Intervention effects are inferred\
  \ where  possible.\nTo model deaths and hospitalizations in the population, we incorporated\
  \  realistic time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization to \
  \ ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to perform \
  \ a county-level age standardization of health outcome risk. Currently, we  assume\
  \ a 0.25% infection fatality rate and a 7:1 ratio of incident  hospitalizations\
  \ to deaths. \nFor each county, we estimate the seeding time and amount, the baseline\
  \  reproductive number, the case confirmation to infection ratio, and the  effectiveness\
  \ of interventions (from closing to phased reopenings). We use an  MCMC-like inference\
  \ procedure that calibrates model outputs to weekly county  aggregations of incident\
  \ confirmed cases and deaths as reported by USA  Facts. For the inference of the\
  \ baseline reproductive number and the case  confirmation to infection ratio, hierarchical\
  \ grouping terms enable sharing  of strength among counties in the same state.\n\
  Our procedure forecasts incident and cumulative deaths by incorporating the last\
  \ reported data point (pre-forecast date) from USA Facts.\nThe estimates reported\
  \ by this model incorporate uncertainty in both epidemiological parameters (e.g.,\
  \ R0, infectious period, time delays to health outcomes) and the effectiveness\
  \ of state-wide intervention policies  on social distancing, stay-at-home orders,\
  \ and phased reopenings. We submit a case-optimized calibration to forecast confirmed\
  \ cases and a deaths-optimized calibration to forecast deaths and hospitalizations."
