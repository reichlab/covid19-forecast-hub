  team_model_designation: primary
  ensemble_of_hub_models: false
  methods:  This model jointly trains over locations, fitting to both  mechanistic and
    statistical models. The statistical model  enforces  similar places having  similar mechanistic 
    coefficients.

  methods_long: The model uses a detailed list of demographic parameters for US Counties, with demographic parameters taken 
    from https://github.com/Yu-Group/covid19-severity-prediction/ and other variables (weather, mobility, etc) 
    taken from the Opencovid Data Repo.   The prediction rollouts from the model are generated from the mechanistic model, where the allowed range 
    of mechanistic parameters is fit on historical data for coverage. To arrive at the best model, we experimented with a large range of mechanistic and statistical models and 
    competed these models against each other. For mechanistic models, we tried SEIR models and curve fitting models. For the 
    statistical model, we tried linear model and  a simple multilayer perceptron. We experimented with statistical models 
    enforcing constraints among different numbers of the mechanistic parameters. We also tried models with priors and without. 
    We also varied how much of the trajectories are fitted with the model (last 4 week, 6 week, and so forth).  
    Including all combinatorial choices, we ended up with 450 different models.  We evaluated model performance with split dates 
    trained in the past and chose the best models. The best models ended up being (i) a multiplicative growth model for the
    mechanistic term with a linear statistical model in which the statistical model enforces constraints on all mechanistic parameters.  
    (ii) A curve fitting mode [CITE paper] with a pseudolikelihood prior, together with a linear statistical model on all mechanistic parameters. 
    The predictions here ensemble these two models.
