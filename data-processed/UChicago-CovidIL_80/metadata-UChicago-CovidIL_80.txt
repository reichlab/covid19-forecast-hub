team_model_designation: other
methods: This is a compartmental, age-structured SEIR model that infers past  SARS-CoV-2
  transmission rates and forecasts mortality  under current and hypothetical public
  health interventions.
team_funding: NIH
data_inputs: Confirmed COVID-19 deaths by EMS region in Illinois; ICU beds occupied
  by confirmed COVID-19 patients by EMS region in Illinois
methods_long: "The model is age-structured to capture both age-specific contact patterns\
  \ and age-specific differences in the biological dynamics, such as the probability\
  \ of asymptomatic infection. Each model compartment is sub-divided into nine different\
  \ age categories.  To model the state of Illinois, we divide the state into 3 regions\
  \ based on similarities in epidemic dynamics. We infer a common statewide pre-intervention\
  \ transmission rate, and a separate post-intervention transmission rate for each\
  \ of the three regions. We also infer a region-specific initial number of infected\
  \ individuals. Other model parameters are informed by Illinois-specific data or\
  \ best estimates from existing literature. We fit the model to incident in-hospital\
  \ deaths and confirmed COVID-19 ICU cases prior to May 8, 2020.   For inference,\
  \ we use maximum likelihood inference via sequential Monte Carlo for partially observed\
  \ Markov process models (POMP). \t We assume that hospitalized deaths are reported\
  \ with probability 0.8075. Because we do not know what might cause underreporting\
  \ of non-hospitalized deaths, our simulations integrate over that uncertainty by\
  \ assuming that the reporting rate for non-hospitalized deaths is uniformly distributed\
  \ from 0.25 to 0.75. The model can be adapted to investigate different types of\
  \ interventions.  We currently model shelter-in-place as a reduction in the overall\
  \ transmission rate, which is shared by all infected individuals, and reductions\
  \ in age- and location-specific contact rates.\nTo model the relaxing of shelter-in-place\
  \ interventions, we project four different scenarios. 1) The inferred post-intervention\
  \ transmission rate remains unchanged. We assume that this is maximum reduction\
  \ in transmission and call this model CovidIL_100. At our current estimates, this\
  \ corresponds to a 78% reduction in pre-intervention transmission. 2) Transmission\
  \ rates increase to 80% of the maximum reduction in transmission according to a\
  \ logistic function centered on May 29. We call this model CovidIL_80. At our current\
  \ estimates, this corresopnds to a 74% reduction in pre-intervention transmission.\
  \ 3) Transmission rates increase to 60% of the maximum reduction in transmission\
  \ according to a logistic function centered on May 29. We call this model CovidIL_60.\
  \ At our current estimates, this corresopnds to a 69% reduction in pre-intervention\
  \ transmission. 4) Transmission rates increase to 40% of the maximum reduction in\
  \ transmission according to a logistic function centered on May 29. We call this\
  \ model CovidIL_40. At our current estimates, this corresopnds to a 65% reduction\
  \ in pre-intervention transmission."
