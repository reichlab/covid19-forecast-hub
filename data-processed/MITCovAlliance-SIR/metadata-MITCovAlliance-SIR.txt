team_model_designation: primary
methods: SIR model trained on public heath regions. SIR parameters are functions of
  static demographic and time-varying mobility features. Two-stage approach that first
  learns magnitude of peak infections.
data_inputs: NYT county-level cases and deaths. County and state-level static and
  dynamic covariates related to pace of disease transmission rate from Safegraph,
  US Census Bureau, CDC, Claritas, University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study

methods_long: A SIR model trained at the public heath region level. SIR parameters
  are functions of over 60 static demographic features and time-varying dynamic features
  that measure changes in mobility patterns. This model proposes a two stage approach
  to overcome the inherent difficulty in learning the magnitude of the peak infection
  rate. The first stage treats the total susceptible population as an unknown parameter
  and learns this parameter for regions that have not yet seen a peak in cumulative
  infections. The second stage fits a typical SIR model with time and location varying
  contact parameters.
