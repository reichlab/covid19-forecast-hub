    Spatiotemporal Dynamics, Nowcasting and Forecasting of COVID-19 in the United States.

methods_long: >-
    We develop a nonparametric space-time disease transmission model for the epidemic data, and to study the spatial-temporal pattern in the spread of COVID-19 at the county level. The proposed methodology can be used to dissect the spatial structure and dynamics of spread, as well as to forecast how this outbreak may unfold through time and space in the future.
