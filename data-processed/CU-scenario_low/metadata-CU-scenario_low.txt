methods: We produce different intervention scenarios, assuming various interventions
  and rates of compliance are implemented in the future. This projection assumes relatively
  low transmission.

methods_long: 'This metapopulation county-level SEIR model makes projections of future
  COVID-19 incidence and deaths.  We produce a number of different intervention scenarios,
  each assuming various interventions and rates of compliance are implemented in the
  future.   The alternate model names below correspond with the filenames in our repository
  and visualizations. July19 - present ''reduce10'': This scenario assumes a weekly
    10% decrease in contact rates.   June 14 - July18  ''5_2xhold'': This scenario assumes a weekly
  5% increase in contact rates for two weeks.  The following week, the reproduction
  number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection.   May 3 - June 7 ''80contact1x5p''
  : This scenario assumes a weekly 20% decrease in counties with growing weekly cases
  and stay-at-home orders in place, and a one-time 5% increase in states that have
  reopened. April 12 - April 26 ''60contact'': This scenario mimics adaptive adjustments
  in contact imposed both by government regulations (e.g. school closures, restrictions
  on mass gatherings) and population self-regulation (e.g. isolation, mask wearing,
  social distancing).  Upon initiation of projections, all counties with 10 or more
  confirmed cases impose a 40% contact rate reduction. Each week following, if a county
  newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 40% contact rate reduction is imposed, depending
  on the projection scenario. Counties that had previously exceeded 10 confirmed cases
  and also experience an increase in the number of weekly reported confirmed cases
  impose a further, multiplicative 40% contact rate reduction, depending on the projection
  scenario. '
