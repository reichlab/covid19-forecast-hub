team_model_designation: primary
methods: Nation-level model of confirmed cases and deaths based on ridge regression.  No
  assumptions made about social distancing.
team_funding: University of Michigan
methods_long: "This model uses ridge regression (penalized Ordinary Least Squares\
  \ regression) to make predictions about future confirmed case and mortality trends.\
  \  The model makes forecasts based solely on previous data, so no external  assumptions\
  \ are necessary.    \nThe ridge regressors built for this model use Finite Impulse\
  \ Response (FIR)  filtration to predict each day's confirmed cases and deaths as\
  \ a function of  the counts on previous days. Specifically, each day's counts are\
  \ predicted as  a linear combination of the counts on a user-specified number of\
  \ previous days.  The goal of the regressors is the determination of an optimal\
  \ coefficient vector  for these predictive linear combinations. The model currently\
  \ makes predictions  based on the previous 15 days.\nOnce a spectrum of forecasts\
  \ is produced, a TensorFlow module is used to create  quantile predictions based\
  \ off of the accumulated projections. Finally, a gradient  boosting regressor is\
  \ used to provide a least squares fit to the projections and  is used to provide\
  \ point predictions."
