methods_long: "We incorporate mobility information into a simplified SIR model which\
  \ has an analytical solution with only two fitting parameters. Without any social-\
  \ distancing policy or geological/demographic inputs, the model works very well \
  \ for the twenty hardest-hit counties in the United States. This model is quite \
  \ different from other models yet provide parameters with clear physical meaning. \
  \ We have shown the cumulative mobility plays the role of time in controling \
  \ exponential growth of outbreak. Furthermore, there exists a critical relative \
  \ mobility above which outbreak will occur. For NYC, this critical relative \
  \ mobility is 30%. The critical relative mobility is ~60% for all other counties. \
  \ In this forecast, we chose the ~30 heaviest hit states, while combine the rest \
  \ of the states together into one superstate. This practice is necessary to obtain \
  \ meaningful model parameters. The forecast is based on Eq. 3 of the citation above, \
  \ fatality-reference, which is the average of the 11-day-period prior to prediction-date. \
  \ The cumulative mobility is the average of three Google mobility categories: \
  \ retail and recreation, transit station and work place. We have shown in \
  \ our paper those three categorites behave similarly. We conducted standard error \
  \ analysis on our forecast in which the uncertainty comes from both the fitting \
  \ error and the variation of the reference fatality. Quantile forecast is calculated \
  \ based on standard error assuming normal distribution. State-level forecast has been \
  \ included for 32 states. Other states and county-level forecast will be included later.\
  \ Starting Nov 29th, we included a summer reduction of 10% from 06/01 to 09/01 and an \
  \ election mobility increase of 25% from 09/01 to 11/03. The summer reduction of mobility \
  \ accounts for elevated outdoor activities while election mobility increase accounts for \
  \ large gatherings of political rally which maybe washed out in the averaged state-mobility. \
  \ We assume 70% of the vulnerable population will be vaccinated within two months. \
  \ The assumption is antibody will be effective 3 weeks after the first shot. \
  \ To account for the recent mutations, we increases the infection rate by 5%. \
  \ Two vaccination scenarios have been considered and predicted which are shown in our website. \
  \ Google mobility data may have been affected by a recent Sep update. \
  \ Due to the significant impact of the new variants, and the complexity involving vaccination, \
  \ our simple mechanistic model cannot make meaningful prediction based on past mobility-fatality\
  \ data anymore. Therefore, we will stop generating forecast as of April 5, 2021. This concludes \
  \ our past eight months of involvement of this forecast efforts."
