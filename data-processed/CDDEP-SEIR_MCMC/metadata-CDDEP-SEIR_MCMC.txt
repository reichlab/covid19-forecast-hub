team_model_designation: primary
methods: County-level SEIR model forecasts of incident (weekly) cases number by fitting
  predicted cases to the observations.
data_inputs: NYTimes time-series cases and deaths data
methods_long: "We break down the SEIR model into 7 compartments:  Susceptible individuals\
  \ (S),  Exposed individuals (E),  Contagious individuals who are asymptomatic or\
  \ mildly symptomatic (C),  Infected with moderate or non-severe symptoms (I_N),\
  \  Infected with severe symptoms (I_S),  Recovered (R) and Deaths (D). \nWe fit\
  \ our model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method in each county\
  \ to estimate  the parameters set (alpha, beta, mu, h, gamma, theta, delta...).\
  \ We start with the initial parameters set  from other studies and iterate the set\
  \ in the model by calculating and comparing the likelihood values between  the real\
  \ cases and projected cases, finally we get our best projected curve (with 95% confidence\
  \ interval) which  has minimum sum of squared residuals (SSR)."
