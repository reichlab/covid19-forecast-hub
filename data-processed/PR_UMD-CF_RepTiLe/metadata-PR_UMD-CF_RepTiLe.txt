methods_long: CF_RepTiLe performs COVID Forecasting on state- and national-level case
  data using Representational Time series Learning. RepTiLe is a meta-learning algorithm
  that takes as inputs a collection of related time series data, uses a recurrent
  neural network model known as reservoir computing to form a separate dynamical representation
  of each time series, and learns a low-dimensional representation of these dynamical
  representations. When confronted with a small amount of new data, RepTiLe finds
  a latent variable that generates a dynamical system whose outputs best approximate
  the new data, effectively doing parameter estimation within a learned space. For
  forecasting COVID cases, the collection of related time series data consists of
  90-day windows of case counts from all states and at the national level. For forecasting
  the future case count for a given state, the previous 10 days are used to fit the
  predictive model. CF_RepTiLe is almost entirely model-agnostic, making no assumptions
  about disease dynamics per se. It relies on the power of the generic meta-learning
  algorithm RepTiLe as well as the assumption that the case dynamics across all states
  and waves are fundamentally described by a small but known set of parameters that
  can be gleaned from historical data.
