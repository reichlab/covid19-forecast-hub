  on infections and deaths.
methods_long: 'We''ve built a simulator based on the SEIR model with learned parameters
  to make daily projections regarding  COVID-19 infections and deaths in all 50 US
  states and 40 countries. The model also accounts for individual  state-by-state
  reopenings and the resulting effects on infections and deaths. The parameters/inputs
  of this  simulator are learned using hyperparameter optimization that minimizes
  the error between the projected outputs  (projected daily deaths) and the actual
  results (reported daily deaths). Because the infections curve is unique  for every
  region, we let the model use each region''s own data to learn the best set of parameters
  for that region.  This includes parameters such as: mortality rate, initial R_0,
  post-lockdown R, and the inflection date of any lockdowns.  Other variables such
  as the latency period, infectious period, and virus shedding period are fixed based
  on published  literature. After some additional validation techniques to minimize
  overfitting, we use the learned parameters to  simulate the future and make projections.'
