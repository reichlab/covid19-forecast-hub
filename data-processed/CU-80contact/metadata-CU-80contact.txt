    This model makes predictions about the future that are dependent on a particular set 
    of assumptions about how interventions are implemented and how effective they are. 
    Metapopulation county-level SEIR model assuming contacts are reduced weekly to 80% of 
    the previous week (20% reduction).

    This model makes predictions about the future that are dependent on a particular set 
    of assumptions about how interventions are implemented and how effective they are. 
    Estimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths were 
    calculated for all US counties. 
    Four different adaptive scenarios of contact reduction were projected, 0% (no contact reduction via social distancing controls and behavior change), 20%, 30%, and 40% contact reduction. These scenarios are meant to mimic adaptive adjustments in contact imposed both by government regulations (e.g. school closures, restrictions on mass gatherings) and population self-regulation (e.g. isolation, mask wearing, social distancing).  Upon initiation of projections, all counties with 10 or more confirmed cases impose a 0%, 20%, 30% or 40% contact rate reduction, depending on the projection scenario; all other counties implement no contact reduction.  Each week following, if a county newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 0%, 20%, 30% or 40% contact rate reduction is imposed, depending on the projection scenario. Counties that had previously exceeded 10 confirmed cases and also experience an increase in the number of weekly reported confirmed cases impose a further, multiplicative 0%, 20%, 30% or 40% contact rate reduction, depending on the projection scenario.  Counties with fewer than 10 confirmed cases continue not to implement control.  This multiplicative ratcheting of contact reduction levels is continued until the end of simulations and is meant to represent increasing reactive social distancing imposed within counties as long as confirmed weekly cases of COVID-19 continue to rise.
