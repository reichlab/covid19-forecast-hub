    County-level metapopulation model with commuting and stochastic SEIR disease dynamics. This model makes predictions about the future based on the best available information about state-level restrictions and their publicly-stated (past or future) start and end dates, assuming moderate intervention effectiveness. Prediction intervals include uncertainty from two different R0 reduction levels that reflect our uncertainty about the effectiveness of these state-level restrictions.

    This is a county-level metapopulation model with stochastic SEIR disease dynamics.  This model incorporates uncertainty in epidemiological parameters and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies on social distancing and stay-at-home orders. Infections are seeded stochastically with roughly 10 times the number of confirmed cases in the first five days of a county epidemic and R0 and the duration of the infectious period were drawn stochastically for each county and simulation. Disease follows SEIR dynamics and county commuting data modulates the spread of disease within counties. Social distancing and stay-at-home orders were applied with an assumed moderate effectiveness and lifted at the state level according to the most recent policy documents. If there were no projected end dates for stay-at-home orders, policies were assumed to end after six weeks. After stay-at-home orders end, social distancing was assumed to occur at half the effectiveness of the stay-at-home order through the end of the simulation period. To model deaths in the population, we incorporated realistic time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization to ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to standardize the probability of transition through these states by county. The estimates reported by this model incorporate uncertainty in epidemiological parameters (e.g., R0, infectious period, time delays to health outcomes, infection fatality ratio). Model projections are not proper forecasts, but the results of planning scenarios calibrated to incident cases and deaths as reported by JHU CSSE.
