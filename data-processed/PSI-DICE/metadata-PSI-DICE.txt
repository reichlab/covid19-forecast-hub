methods_long: "Deterministic fit of a compartmental SEIR model to daily hospitalization incidence\
  \ profiles, followed by stochastic simulations using the inferred parameter distributions.\
  \ The 'I' compartments are divided by disease severity into Mild (non-clinical) and\
  \ Clinical.  A portion of clinical cases will proceed to the hospitalization compartment.\
  \ And then again there is a probability of moving from hospitalization to death. The model fit\
  \ is inferred by MCMC procedure, run forward at a daily cadence, and then aggregated to weekly\
  \ incidence to produce the forecast. The initial model does not include climate data, school\
  \ schedules, or coupling between states, but we will provide updates as those factors are\
  \ incorporated into the model."
