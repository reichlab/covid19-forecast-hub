<img src="https://github.com/chiangwe/HawkPR/blob/master/figure/Frame_work.png?raw=true" width="800px">

## Dependencies 
Matlab 2018b
## Functions
### HawkPR.m: Main functions for EM algorithm.
### Hawkes_Sim_Corona.m: Simulation of Hawkes processes after estimation.
### updatep.m: Expectione step.
### discrete_hawkes.m: discretize the simualtion results.

## Quick run
### Use MLE estimate shape and scale parameters for Weibull distribution
#### HawkPR('./input_data/NYT_Dconfirmed.csv', './input_data/GoogleMobi_Dconfirmed.csv', './input_data/Demo_Dconfirmed.csv', 14, '', '', 200, 7, 100, './output/mdl.mat', './output/pred.csv')
### Specify shape and scale parameters for Weibull distribution
#### HawkPR('./input_data/NYT_Dconfirmed.csv', './input_data/GoogleMobi_Dconfirmed.csv', './input_data/Demo_Dconfirmed.csv', 14, 8, 4, 200, 7, 100, './output/mdl.mat', './output/pred.csv')

## Function parameters
### HawkPR( InputPath_report, InputPath_mobility, InputPath_demography, Delta, Alpha, Beta, EMitr, DaysPred, SimTimes, OutputPath_mdl, OutputPath_pred)
| Functiona parameter  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| InputPath_report  | Input path for COVID daily report  |
| InputPath_mobility  | Input path for mobiblity report.  |
| InputPath_demography  | Input path for spatial demographic features.  |
| Delta  | Days lagged for mobility.  |
| Alpha  | Shape parameters for Weibull distribution. Leave it blank string as '' to allow MSE estimation.  |
| Beta  | Scale parameters for Weibull distribution. Leave it blank string as '' to allow MSE estimation.  |
| EMitr | Maximum iterations for EM algorithm  |
| DaysPred | Number of days to make prediction.  |
| SimTimes | Simulation times for Hawkes processes. Nota that the prediction is the average of number of simulated events among all simulations.  |
| OutputPath_mdl  | Output path for the trained model. |
| OutputPath_pred  | Output path for prediction results.  |

## Input Data format
### COVID daily report
- In csv file format. The header should contain "FIPS,State,County,x2020-02-15, ..."
- Date format is in x + 4 digits year + 2 digits month + 2 digits day, i,g., x2020-02-15.
- Each row is a covid daily report for each county.
- The total number of rows is the number of counties.
### Mobility indices
- In csv file format. The header should contain "FIPS,State,County,Type,x2020-02-15 ..."
- Date format is in x + 4 digits year + 2 digits month + 2 digits day, i,g., x2020-02-15.
- Each row is a mobility indices for each county for each type of mobility.
- The total number of rows is the number of counties X number of mobility types
### Spatial demographic features
- In csv file format. The header should contain "FIPS,State,County,Feature 1,Feature 2, ..."
- Each row is demographic features for each county.
- The total number of rows is the number of counties.

## Examples of training data in './input_data/'
| Functiona parameter  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| NYT_Dconfirmed.csv  | COVID daily confirmed cases collected by The New York Times (counties with confirmed cases >= 10) |
| NYT_Ddeath.csv  | COVID daily deaths collected by The New York Times (counties with deaths >= 1) |
| GoogleMobi_Dconfirmed.csv | Google mobility of counties in NYT_Dconfirmed.csv  (Imputated)  |
| GoogleMobi_Ddeath.csv  | Google mobility of counties in NYT_Ddeath.csv (Imputated)  |
| Demo_Dconfirmed.csv  | Demographic features of counties in NYT_Dconfirmed.csv   |
| Demo_Ddeath.csv  | Demographic features of counties in NYT_Ddeath.csv  |

## Examples of output data in './output/'
### mdl.mat
- model is save in mat files. (load('mdl.mat') can load the models in MATLAB)
- variable 'mdl' is the summary of Poisson regression model including coefficients
- variable 'mus' is the background rate (Exogenous infections)
- variable 'K0' is the estimated reproduction number
- variable 'alpha, beta' are the esimtated shape and scale parameter for the Weibull distribution 
### pred.csv
- In csv file format. The header should contain "FIPS,State,County,x2020_05_21 ..."
- Date format is in x + 4 digits year + 2 digits month + 2 digits day, i,g., x2020_05_21.
- Each row is a mobility indices for each county for each type of mobility.
- There are 'DaysPred' days of prediction starting from the day after the last day in COVID report.
