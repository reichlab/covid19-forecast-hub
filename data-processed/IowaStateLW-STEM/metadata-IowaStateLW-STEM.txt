methods: Spatiotemporal Dynamics, Nowcasting and Forecasting of COVID-19 in the United
  States.
data_inputs: New York Times -nytimes/covid-19-data, health department webpages,  County-level
  infected case and death data
methods_long: We develop a nonparametric space-time disease transmission model for
  the epidemic data, and to study the spatial-temporal pattern in the spread of COVID-19
  at the county level. The proposed methodology can be used to dissect the spatial
  structure and dynamics of spread, as well as to forecast how this outbreak may unfold
  through time and space in the future. The projections assume that the data used
  is reliable, the future will continue to follow the current pattern, and current
  interventions will remain the same till the end of forecasting period.
