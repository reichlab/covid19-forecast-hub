team_model_designation: secondary
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
methods: 'Gradient boosting for the median, followed by conformal prediction to get quantiles'
methods_long: 'Bagged gradient boosting is used to obtain a predictive median.
  Features include the day of week, location, population, and summaries of time
  series behavior. Quantiles are obtained via a procedure similar to split
  conformal prediction, where quantiles of the out-of-bag residuals are added to
  the point predictions obtained from gradient boosting.'
data_inputs: HHS Protect hospitalization data via COVIDcast.
