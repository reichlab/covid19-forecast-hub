methods: 'Equally weighted ensemble of simple time-series baseline models.'
methods_long: 'Equally weighted ensemble of simple time-series baseline models. Each 
  baseline model calculates first differences of incidence in recent weeks. 
  These differences are sampled and then added to the most recently observed 
  incidence. Variations on this method include (a) including the first 
  differences and the negative of these differences to enforce symmetry, 
  resulting in a flat-line forecast, (b) varying the number of time-units in the
  past for computing the first differences (typically 14, 21, or 28 days) to 
  focus on capturing recent trends, and (c) using the original time-series or a 
  variance-stabilizing transformation of it, e.g. square-root. Additionally, the
  resulting predictive distributions are truncated so that any predicted samples
  computed to be less than zero are truncated to be zero.'
