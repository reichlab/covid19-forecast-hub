data_inputs: cumulative and incident deaths or cases
methods_long: 'For predictions of incidence, the median prediction at all future horizons
  is the most recent observed incidence.  Predictions of cumulative counts are derived
  from predictions of incidence; this means that the slope of the predictive medians
  for cumulative quantities from one week to the next will be constant and equal to
  the last observed slope.  To get a distribution around the median, we look at how
  much incidence has changed from week to week in the past, and we allow for the possibility
  that similar changes will occur again in the future.

  In more technical detail, forecasts of incidence are generated through the following
  procedure: 1) Calculate first differences of incidence; 2) Collect all first differences
  and their negatives; 3) Sample first differences in incidence and add to the most
  recent observed incidence; 4) Enforce that the mean of the predictive distribution
  for incidence is equal to the most recent observed incidence; 5) truncate the predictive
  distribution for incidence at 0.  Forecasts of cumulative quantities are obtained
  by adding forecasts of incidence to the last observed cumulative value.'
