methods_long: "This is a near-term fatality prediction model that calculates and\
  \ uses fatality trends at the national and state level, trends in positive virus\
  \ tests and total virus tests, and age-related demographics for state forecasts.\n\
  Model forecasts are based on predicting near-term deaths from recent positive virus\
  \ tests and recent deaths. The model assumes average delays of 14-21 days from positive test to death.\
  \ The specific model chosen varies state by state and is selected based on the historical accuracy of each method \
  \ in each state and/or the historical accuracy of the error-corrected version of each method.\
  \ No assumptions are made about the effectiveness of interventions or treatments;\
  \ the model assumes that any such change in effectiveness will be included implicitly\
  \ in the historical fatality data and the fatality rates calculated from that data.\
  \ This model uses a Rational Actor assumption for week 4, in which states that \
  \ have death rates below their historical averages remain flat and states that have \
  \ death rates above their historical averages revert toward their averages. \
  \ No assumptions are made regarding specifics of reopenings or specific governmental interventions."
