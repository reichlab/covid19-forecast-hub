methods: 'Estimate the effective reproduction number and conduct forecast for the  number
  of daily new cases and death based on an extended varying coefficient  SEIR model. '
data_inputs: https://covidtracking.com; confirmed cases; reported fatalities; population
methods_long: 'May 23: We propose an extended varying coefficient Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered
  (vSEIdR) model, which extends the classical epidemic SIR and SEIR models by allowing
  infections in the exposed E state. This would better capture the COVID-19 reality
  that most infections are made before clinical diagnosed.'
