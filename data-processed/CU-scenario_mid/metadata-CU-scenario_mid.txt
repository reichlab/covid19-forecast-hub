    This projection assumes moderate transmission.  It assumes that current levels of social mixing will remain unchanged in the future.  In addition, it assumes a seasonal decrease in disease transmission leading to a weekly 4% decrease in reproductive number R(t).

    This metapopulation county-level SEIR model makes projections of future COVID-19 incidence and deaths.  We produce a number of different intervention scenarios, each assuming various interventions and rates of compliance are implemented in the future.    
    June 14 - present 'season4': This scenario assumes that current contact rates will remain unchanged in the future.  In addition, we assume a seasonal decrease in disease transmission leading to a weekly 4% decrease in reproductive number R(t).
    May 3 - June 7 '80contactw5p': For states maintaining or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we apply a 20% weekly reductions of contact rates, as described above. However, in states that reopen, we apply an increase to the contact rate of counties in those states. In the first scenario, we apply a one-time 10% increase to the contact rate during the week that the state is scheduled to reopen and maintain this new increased rate for the remainder of the projection.
    April 12 - April 26 '70contact': This scenario mimics adaptive adjustments in contact imposed both by government regulations (e.g. school closures, restrictions on mass gatherings) and population self-regulation (e.g. isolation, mask wearing, social distancing).  Upon initiation of projections, all counties with 10 or more confirmed cases impose a 30% contact rate reduction. Each week following, if a county newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 30% contact rate reduction is imposed, depending on the projection scenario. Counties that had previously exceeded 10 confirmed cases and also experience an increase in the number of weekly reported confirmed cases impose a further, multiplicative 30% contact rate reduction, depending on the projection scenario.
