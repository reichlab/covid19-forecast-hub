team_model_designation: primary
methods: 'A stochastic/deterministic, single-population SEIRX model that stratifies
  by both age distribution and disease severity and includes generic intervention
  fitting. '
team_funding: NSF
repo_url: https://github.com/predsci/DRAFT
data_inputs: JHU cumulative deaths,  U.S. Census populations and age distributions
methods_long: "Deterministic fit of a compartmental SEIRX model to cumulative death
  profiles, followed by stochastic simulations using the optimal parameters. All compartments
  are stratified by age. 'I' compartments are additionally divided by disease severity
  into Asymptomatic, Mild, Flu-like, and Severe.  Severe disease is defined by the
  need for an ICU bed. Interventions are fit generically to a three value smooth function.  Forward
  projections are conditional on interventions/reproductive number remaining unchanged.\n Updates:\n July 20 - model is fit using MCMC procedure"
