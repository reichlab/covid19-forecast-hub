methods_long: "We incorporate mobility information into a simplified SIR model which\
  \ has an analytical solution with only two fitting parameters. Without any social-\
  \ distancing policy or geological/demographic inputs, the model works very well \
  \ for the twenty hardest-hit counties in the United States. This model is quite \
  \ different from other models yet provide parameters with clear physical meaning. \
  \ We have shown the cumulative mobility plays the role of time in controling \
  \ exponential growth of outbreak. Furthermore, there exists a critical relative \
  \ mobility above which outbreak will occur. For NYC, this critical relative \
  \ mobility is 30%. The critical relative mobility is ~60% for all other counties. \
  \ In this forecast, we chose the 31 heaviest hit states, while combine the rest \
  \ of the states together into one superstate. This practice is necessary to obtain \
  \ meaningful model parameters. The forecast is based on Eq. 3 of the citation above \
  \ in which the reference fatality is a 11-day average centered on 07-28-2020. \
  \ The cumulative mobility is the average of three Google mobility categories: \
  \ retail and recreation, transit station and work place. We have shown in \
  \ our paper those three categorites behave similarly. We conducted standard error \
  \ analysis on our forecast in which the uncertainty comes from both the fitting \
  \ error and the variation of the reference fatality. Quantile forecast is calculated \
  \ based on standard error assuming normal distribution. State-level forecast and \
  \ county-level forecast will be conducted later."
