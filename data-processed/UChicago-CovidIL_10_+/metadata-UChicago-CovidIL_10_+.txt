team_model_designation: other
methods: This is a compartmental, age-structured SEIR model that infers past  SARS-CoV-2
  transmission rates and forecasts mortality  under current and hypothetical public
  health interventions.
team_funding: NIH
data_inputs: Confirmed COVID-19 deaths by EMS region in Illinois; ICU beds occupied
  by confirmed COVID-19 patients by EMS region in Illinois
methods_long: 'The model is age-structured to capture both age-specific contact patterns
  and age-specific differences in the biological dynamics, such as the probability
  of asymptomatic infection. Each model compartment is sub-divided into nine different
  age categories.  To model the state of Illinois, we divide the state into four regions
  based on the Restore Illinois plan. We infer a common statewide pre-intervention
  transmission rate, and a separate post-intervention transmission rate for each of
  the four regions. We also infer a region-specific initial number of infected individuals.
  Other model parameters are informed by Illinois-specific data or best estimates
  from existing literature. We fit the model to incident in-hospital deaths and confirmed
  COVID-19 ICU cases prior to May 15, 2020.   For inference, we use maximum likelihood
  inference via sequential Monte Carlo for partially observed Markov process models
  (POMP).   We assume that hospitalized deaths are reported with probability 0.8075
  and we fitted the reporting rate of non-hospitalized deaths.  The model can be adapted
  to investigate different types of interventions.  We currently model shelter-in-place
  as a reduction in the overall transmission rate, which is shared by all infected
  individuals, and reductions in age- and location-specific contact rates.

  To model the relaxing of shelter-in-place interventions, we project three different
  scenarios. 1) The inferred post-intervention transmission rate remains unchanged.
  We assume that this is maximum reduction in transmission and call this model CovidIL_100.
  2) The post-SIP transmission rate increases 10% of the way back to pre-SIP transmission
  according to a logistic function centered on June 1. We call this model CovidIL_10_increase.
  3) The post-SIP transmission rate increases 30% of the way back to pre-SIP transmission
  according to a logistic function centered on June 1. We call this model CovidIL_30_increase.'
