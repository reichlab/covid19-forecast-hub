# USAFacts truth data

To update these data run (in R):

    source("usafacts.R")
    
This will "copy" the appropriate files from the 
[USAFacts website](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/)
to [raw/](./raw).

Then it will wrangle the data into the same format as other truth data.
